Rewind our clocks, back to the start!
The burden is mine alone to bear...
Become one with the endless now.
Endlessly adrift, infinitely wandering...
Look up, face forward, and just walk on.
I love this world because you're in it.
I can't kill you, but I will stop your blade...
I am Monado.
All that I am... is fading...
Memories melt in the moonlight...
Infinite paths stretch out before you...
There can be but one me, and I am it!
Imagine the worlds I could've seen...
I have a heart no less human than yours.
They all desired oblivion, and now they have it.
Do you think games are silly little things?
A future is something you must take for yourself.
It always ends like this.
I never quite realized ... how beautiful this world is.
You don't get to decide who lives and who dies...
All I brought you was pain...
Your kingdom will die alongside you, by my hand.
O worthy heart, who tempers anxiety into strength...
You have the power to change fate itself.
Time marches on without end...
And thus, boy met girl.
She's more than just the Aegis, or some weapon...
She's a living being!
Her flames hide something deeper...
I'll never forget it, the day you set me free...
free from a life of misery.
So tell me... how was it, being alive?
Let's begin the experiment!
Today, mankind moves one step closer to the divine!
We are on the verge of burning even the skies above...
This... is the birth of a brand new universe!
Cheers to old Klaus!
