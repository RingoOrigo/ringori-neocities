The replica title screen for my Xenoblade shrine is actually something I'm really proud of. It ended up so much better than I thought it would given my current skill level and I think it's pretty awesome! (but of course I'm a bit biased) Hopefully later the theme menu can replicate an in-game menu later. It's something I want to do, but it's not my highest priority at the moment.

The Xenoblade shrine is officially in progress. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is a very special game to me, so I'm basing it mainly off of that. I want to recreate the title screen more closely, so if anyone can find a font that matches better PLEASE let me know!!!!!!! Later on, I'll hopefully have a theme switcher and change the background for each different title screen. That'll come later, though, stay tuned!

I'm liking how this website is coming along :) As of right now, this section is completely manual, but I might put together a small script to automatically populate this section from a text file. Ideally an external one, even, as not to bloat the website's size. I also want to implement a more proper chatbox rather than the external guestbook that I have now.
